# EqBaB Tool Guide #
This tool guide shows how to reproduce the same result. As our tool is based on the alpha-beta-crown, please install the crwon tool first.
1. Install alpha-beta-crwon.
2. Test on the example in alpha-beta-crwon and make sure it can work as expected.
3. Download files from self_doc and put the folder in the root folder of the alpha-beta-crown.
4. Download abcrown_test_cifar.py, abcrown_test_mnist.py, model_defs.py and put them in the root folder of the alpha-beta-crown.
5. Run abcrown_test_cifar.py to get the result for the CIFAR10 experiment, and run abcrown_test_mnist.py to get the result for the MNIST experiment.
